                        JumperProj is a 2D precision platformer developed entirely from scratch using C++ and WinAPI. Players will use 
                        a unique set of controls with the goal of getting to the top, think Jump King meets Celeste. Various level mechanics 
                        exist to impede and push the player forward through the level. Every jump is calculated, be careful or you could find yourself back 
                        at the bottom!

                    This was my first project created without the use of a commercial engine or outside library. I was successful in my intention of dipping my toes
                    into this side of game development and have created a project which will stand as a basis for many future projects. Lots of the code seen throughout this 
                    project will be used again for various other games and other engines I intend to create.

                    After rewriting the tile map system, I knew my ability to quickly get through this project was going to require the ability
                    to edit, save and load a tile map from a file.

                        Keeping similar to the way the rest of the program was designed, each function is declared as a function pointer in the game code 
                        for the platform independent code to define and simply send the result of the function back out to the game code. This is important
                        so that if it ever were to come to porting, all I would need to do is redefine the platform independent implementation of opening, reading and
                        writing to files.

                        I am able to edit the file by simply pressing left click on a tile within the tile map which changes the value of the tile.
                        As for the reading of the file, that's done through a simple file open, write loop. At the start of the program, the 
                        file is loaded from the previous save file kept in a separate directory.

                        For the sound within the project, I decided to use XAudio2 as it was a bit more updated and simpler to work with  
                        compared to DirectSound. I start by loading in the important API functions in dynamically (this way we avoid linking directly to the library).
                        As according the the MSDN documentation, several functions are called in order to initialize our sound including functions for initializing the XAudio interface,
                        and creating a source voice.

                        In order to play an actual sound, the buffer needs to be filled. This is done in the game code as it is something that can be 
                        abstracted out of the platform layer. Through the exported functions in the DLL, the platform layer calls to fill the buffer
                        in the game code. The game code will then fill the buffer which the platform layer then uses to output an actual sound using XAUDIO2_BUFFER
                        struct and the SubmitSourceBuffer function.

                    The final thing I spent working on was making the game look a little more pretty. This involved writing a bitmap loader and using it for the tiles and player.
                    I even took some time to develop a small animation for the player when they were preparing to jump.
