                        Apart is a 2D top-down sokobon style game created using what was left over from the Jumper Engine. Through this project, I will continue
                        to iterate over my current engine as well as develop a short game with it's meaning baked into the gameplay. I have spent a lot of time 
                        researching this type of design and believe I am finally ready to start implementing my ideas!

                <p class="textBoxLargeCenter">
                    There were multiple systems implemented in Jumper Proj that I decided needed some improvements in order to make developing levels easier.
                </p>
            </div>

                        The first of which was re-designing part of the system for selecting tiles. In order to keep the input for the mechanics and the input for 
                        map building separate, I implemented a simple system that would allow me to switch between editing and playing the game by pressing 'Tab'.
                        I also managed to create a simple indicator to help me determine when I was in and out of debug mode.

                        Another improvement I made was how I switched between different tiles during placement. I updated it so that the cursor would change to the tile 
                        I was placing, which made it much easier to see exactly what tile was being usedâ€”unlike before, where I was basically guessing and checking.

                <p class="textBoxLargeCenter">
                    Using an approach known as memory pools, I allocate
                    a large chunk of memory up front, and then use the space to push any struct I need. The memory is then released at the end of the 
                    program as opposed to releasing as according to the lifetime of a specific object. This in turn makes memory management simple to use.

                    <p>
                        I took things a step further when implementing my 'redo' button using a fixed size pool. Whenever the player presses a movement button, their location is recorded
                        in a linked list which is entirely allocated at the start of the program. When adding to the list, we check another list of 'freed' locations which if there are any 
                        we grab from and use to 'allocate' a new node. When the player presses the 'redo' button and the state is set to whichever state existed in the most recent node, 
                        we then 'free' the node by placing it in the list of 'freed' locations.

                <p class="textBoxLargeCenter">
                    As observed from previous projects, keeping structure and style for code is incredibly important. With that being said, I find that
                    the best way to program for my solo projects is to keep everything functional and programming with the purpose of compressing only when absolutely necessary.
                    Through this, I've found a few key benefits:

                <p class="textBoxLargeCenter">
                    First of which being, by not spending time trying to immediately comparmentalize things into functions, I can focus solely on writing code that works.
                    This also makes my code incredibly flexible which allows me change things with ease when I iterate on a design idea.

                        As the most recent example, when developing two entities, the player and the ball, I decided I wanted to switch things up and make it so the player
                        is the ball/has the same properties as the ball in terms of movement. In my structure, ball_entity was a child of entity with player being this type.
                        There were a couple of functions which the ball used for its movement which I needed to swap to allow the player to have. This was a simple 10 minute 
                        fix with a couple of swaps of data types and suddenly I had the characteristics I was looking for.
