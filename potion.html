                    Among many of the mechanics I created, the one I'm choosing to highlight here
                    was one of the more difficult. According to our design, the potion needed to not
                    only align with the ground but with any surface of varying degree.
                </p>

                <p class="textBoxLargeCenter">
                    In order to produce the result you see above, I utilized multiple line traces.
                    The first of which casts horizontally trying to determine if the ground in front of it
                    is angled. If it is, then it spawns the next spike at the hit location taking the normal of the
                    surface into account.
                </p>

                <p class="textBoxLargeCenter">
                    The second line trace only occurs if the first trace didn't hit, in which case this one
                    casts vertically to the ground to determine its location to spawn a new spike.

                    Another system I was in charge of was our camera system.
                    This system worked by constantly getting the player's location and following
                    it along the x and z-axis. To make it feel more juicy, camera lag was introduced via
                    interping the current location to the last location.

                <div class="floatChild" style="text-align:left; padding-top:40px">
                    <p>
                        To make the system more customizable for our level designers,
                        items were exposed to the details panel such as distance from the player,
                        height and lag speed.

                    <p>
                        We also discovered the need for the ability for the camera to be locked
                        depending on combat encounters and so the system was adjusted as so. This
                        is simply triggered by the player walking into the box and can be set back to the
                        regular camera by having the player walk out of the box.

                        This is a demonstration of the Demon Bird enemy I helped design
                        and was in charge of developing. This enemy proved to be difficult with
                        it being in a perpetual state of flying. According to our documentation,
                        the bird required two states.

                    <p style="text-align:right">
                        The first of which was a mid air patrolling. In this state, the bird flys between
                        two target points.

                    <p style="text-align:right">
                        The next state was the attacking state which it entered when the player is in
                        sight of the bird. In this state, it dives down to the player to cause damage only to return
                        to a temporary patrolling state in order to give the player a break between its attacks.

                        This ground dwelling enemy with a long sphere is another enemy I helped design and was
                        tasked with developing. Similar to the Demon Bird, the Goblin also had two states, one being
                        patrolling and the other being attacking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this patrolling state, the Goblin travels between two set patrol points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for its attacking state, the Goblin rushes at the player only to quickly retreat
                        a short distance from them. This behavior continues until either it or the player is dead
                        as it will continue to chase the player. This retreat exists for the same reason it did
                        in the Demon Bird, to give the player a break between attacks as we learned through playtesting
                        the detrimental results of a continuous attack from an enemy.
